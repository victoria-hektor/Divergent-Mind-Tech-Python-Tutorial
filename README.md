# Divergent Mind Tech: Python Basics Tutorial üêç  

Welcome to the **Divergent Mind Tech Python Basics Tutorial**! This project is for anyone wanting a fun, beginner-friendly introduction to Python. It‚Äôs designed to be approachable for neurodivergent learners (like me!) and anyone who prefers learning in bite-sized steps with a touch of humour.

## What‚Äôs in This Tutorial?  

This tutorial walks you through three core concepts in Python:  

1. **Variable Names**  
   - Learn how to name your variables clearly and avoid common mistakes.  
   - Pro tip: Use underscores (`_`) for readability, e.g., `user_name`.  

2. **Functions**  
   - Write reusable blocks of code to save time and stay organised.  
   - Example: A simple function to greet users by name.  

3. **Simple Calculations**  
   - Perform basic arithmetic, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentages.  
   - Example: Calculate the percentage of `a` relative to `b` using `(a / b) * 100`.

Mistakes Are Normal!
As a neurodivergent learner, I often mix things up‚Äîlike forgetting the name for a colon (:) or accidentally misspelling something. It‚Äôs okay! Mistakes are part of the process, and the key is to keep going.
